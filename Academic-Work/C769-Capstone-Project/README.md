# IT Capstone Written Project (C769)

## 📘 Overview
This capstone project focused on improving the security posture of a newly formed LLC that lacked basic authentication controls. The organization had no multi-factor authentication (MFA) in place, leaving its systems and user accounts vulnerable to unauthorized access. The project analyzed the existing weaknesses and developed a structured plan to implement MFA across the environment.

## 🧠 Project Summary
The project evaluated the company’s current authentication practices, identified risks associated with single-factor authentication, and proposed a complete MFA rollout. This included selecting an MFA solution, outlining implementation steps, defining user onboarding procedures, and creating a deployment timeline that minimized disruption to business operations.

## 🛠 Key Deliverables
- Assessment of existing authentication weaknesses  
- MFA solution selection and justification  
- Implementation plan with step-by-step actions  
- Deployment timeline and milestones  
- User onboarding and training recommendations  
- Risk mitigation strategies  
- Final written report documenting the full project  

## 🧩 Skills Demonstrated
- Security assessment and gap analysis  
- Planning and executing a security control rollout  
- Understanding authentication mechanisms and MFA technologies  
- Writing structured technical documentation  
- Communicating security improvements to non-technical stakeholders  
- Project planning and timeline development

## 💬 Reflection
This project helped me apply security concepts in a practical, real-world scenario. Working through the assessment and implementation plan made it clear how much impact a single control—like MFA—can have on an organization’s overall security. It also strengthened my ability to document technical decisions and present them in a structured, professional way.
