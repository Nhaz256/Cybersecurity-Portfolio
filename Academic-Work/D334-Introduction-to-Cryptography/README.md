# Introduction to Cryptography (D334)

## 📘 Overview
This course introduced the fundamental concepts behind modern cryptography, including encryption, hashing, digital signatures, and key management. It explained how cryptographic systems protect data and why certain algorithms are used in secure communications.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Symmetric vs asymmetric encryption
- Hashing algorithms (SHA, MD5, etc.)
- Public key infrastructure (PKI)
- Certificates and certificate authorities
- Digital signatures and message integrity
- Key exchange methods
- Common cryptographic attacks and weaknesses

## 🛠 Skills Gained
- Understanding how encryption protects data in transit and at rest
- Recognizing weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms
- Interpreting certificates and PKI structures
- Identifying where cryptography fits into secure system design
- Applying crypto concepts to authentication and secure communication

## 💬 Reflection
This course helped clarify how cryptographic systems actually work behind the scenes. I had seen many of these concepts before in different contexts, but studying them in a structured way made everything fit together more clearly. It strengthened my understanding of secure communication and gave me a better appreciation for how encryption supports both defensive and offensive security work.
