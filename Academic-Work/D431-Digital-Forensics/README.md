 Digital Forensics in Cybersecurity (D431)

 Overview
This course introduced the fundamentals of digital forensics, including evidence collection, preservation, analysis, and reporting. It covered how investigators identify malicious activity, reconstruct events, and maintain the integrity of digital evidence throughout the process.

 What I Learned
- Forensic investigation methodology
- Chain of custody and evidence handling
- File system analysis
- Log and artifact examination
- Memory and disk imaging concepts
- Identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Basic malware behavior and forensic artifacts
- Reporting findings in a structured format

 Skills Gained
- Preserving and documenting digital evidence
- Analyzing logs and system artifacts for suspicious activity
- Understanding how attackers leave traces behind
- Using forensic tools and structured investigation techniques
- Reconstructing events based on digital footprints

 Reflection
This course helped me understand how forensic analysts piece together what happened during an incident. Seeing how evidence is collected and interpreted gave me a clearer sense of how attackers are detected and how their actions can be traced. It strengthened my ability to analyze systems more critically and made a lot of real-world security concepts feel more concrete.
