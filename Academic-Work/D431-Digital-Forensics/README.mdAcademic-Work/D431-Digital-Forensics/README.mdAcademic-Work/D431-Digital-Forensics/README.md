## 💬 Reflection
This course helped me understand how forensic analysts piece together what happened during an incident. Seeing how evidence is collected and interpreted gave me a clearer sense of how attackers are detected and how their actions can be traced. It strengthened my ability to analyze systems more critically and made a lot of real-world security concepts feel more concrete.
