# Military Training Credit – Cyber Defense & Countermeasures (D340)

## 📘 Overview
I received academic credit for D340 based on completing USAF cybersecurity training that covered defensive security concepts, monitoring, compliance, and countermeasures. This was not a traditional course, but rather credit awarded for real-world operational experience.

## 🧠 What the Training Covered
- Defensive security fundamentals
- Monitoring and detection concepts
- Vulnerability management
- Compliance and governance
- Secure configurations and hardening
- Incident response basics

## 🛠 Skills Gained
- Applying defensive controls in operational environments
- Understanding how attackers are detected
- Using DoD tools and compliance frameworks
- Supporting mission assurance through secure configurations

## 💬 Reflection
Although I did not take the academic version of D340, the USAF training that earned this credit directly supports my cybersecurity role and my path toward pentesting and cyber warfare. It strengthened my understanding of defensive operations, which improves my offensive mindset as I pursue Pentest+ and 1B4X1 Cyber Warfare Operations.
