I received academic credit for D340 based on completing USAF cybersecurity training that covered defensive security concepts, monitoring, compliance, and countermeasures. This was not a traditional course, but rather credit awarded for real-world operational experience.

What the Training Covered
- Defensive security fundamentals
- Monitoring and detection concepts
- Vulnerability management
- Compliance and governance
- Secure configurations and hardening
- Incident response basics

 Skills Gained
- Applying defensive controls in operational environments
- Understanding how attackers are detected
- Using DoD tools and compliance frameworks
- Supporting mission assurance through secure configurations

 Reflection
This course strengthened my understanding of the core principles behind security controls and policies. A lot of the concepts connected naturally with things I’ve seen in real environments, and it helped solidify the foundation I rely on when working through more advanced topics.
